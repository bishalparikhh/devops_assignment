# Solution for Cost Optimization in Azure Serverless Architecture with Cosmos DB

To optimize costs while ensuring seamless data access and no service downtime, the proposed solution involves a data archival strategy that leverages Azure Blob Storage for historical data, and retains Cosmos DB for active records. This strategy balances cost reduction while maintaining performance and availability.

Proposed Solution:
1. Overview
The current system stores billing records in Azure Cosmos DB, which is read-heavy and accumulates a large amount of data over time. The challenge is to reduce storage costs while still allowing easy access to older records (older than 3 months) with low latency.

2. Archiving Strategy
To optimize costs:

Active Data (within 3 months): Store in Cosmos DB, which offers fast read/write operations.

Archived Data (older than 3 months): Move older records to Azure Blob Storage (Cold or Archive Tier), which is more cost-efficient for infrequently accessed data.

3. Data Retrieval Optimization
Use Azure Functions or Azure Logic Apps to intercept requests for older records.

If a record is requested and is archived (older than 3 months), retrieve it from Blob Storage and cache it temporarily in Cosmos DB for faster subsequent access.

4. Implementation Steps
1. Data Archival (Move to Blob Storage)
Move records older than 3 months from Cosmos DB to Azure Blob Storage using an Azure Function triggered periodically (e.g., every night).

Use Cosmos DB Change Feed to track record creation dates and identify records older than 3 months.

Write the records to Blob Storage (in the Archive tier) for cost-effective long-term storage.

2. Data Retrieval (On-Demand Fetch)
When a request for an old record is made:

Check if the record is present in Cosmos DB.

If not, retrieve the record from Blob Storage and write it back to Cosmos DB for future quick access.

3. Cache Warm-Up
Consider using Azure Redis Cache to temporarily cache frequently accessed older records.

For records fetched from Blob Storage, store them in Redis for faster subsequent retrieval.

Pseudocode for Archival Logic:
# Azure Function to move old records to Blob Storage

from azure.cosmos import CosmosClient
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient
import datetime

# Initialize clients
cosmos_client = CosmosClient(endpoint_url, credential)
blob_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(connection_string)

# Cosmos DB container
container = cosmos_client.get_database_client(database_name).get_container_client(container_name)

# Blob storage container
blob_container = blob_client.get_container_client("archived-records")

def move_old_records():
    # Get records older than 3 months
    three_months_ago = datetime.datetime.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=90)
    
    # Query Cosmos DB to find records older than 3 months
    query = f"SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.creationDate < '{three_months_ago}'"
    records_to_archive = container.query_items(query, enable_cross_partition_query=True)
    
    for record in records_to_archive:
        # Convert record to byte format for Blob storage
        record_blob_name = f"record_{record['id']}.json"
        blob_container.upload_blob(record_blob_name, json.dumps(record), overwrite=True)
        
        # Optionally delete from Cosmos DB after successful upload
        container.delete_item(record['id'])


Pseudocode for Data Retrieval Logic:

# Azure Function to fetch and restore old records from Blob Storage

from azure.cosmos import CosmosClient
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient

# Initialize clients
cosmos_client = CosmosClient(endpoint_url, credential)
blob_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(connection_string)

# Cosmos DB container
container = cosmos_client.get_database_client(database_name).get_container_client(container_name)

# Blob storage container
blob_container = blob_client.get_container_client("archived-records")

def retrieve_record(record_id):
    # First, check if the record is in Cosmos DB
    try:
        record = container.read_item(item=record_id, partition_key=record_id)
        return record
    except:
        # If not found, fetch from Blob Storage
        record_blob_name = f"record_{record_id}.json"
        
        try:
            # Download the record from Blob Storage
            blob_data = blob_container.download_blob(record_blob_name)
            record_data = blob_data.readall()
            record = json.loads(record_data)
            
            # Optionally, restore record to Cosmos DB for future access
            container.upsert_item(record)
            
            return record
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error fetching record: {str(e)}")
            return None
Cost Optimization Strategies:
Cosmos DB Tiering: Use Cosmos DB's autoscale and multi-region features efficiently to lower storage and query costs based on usage patterns.

Blob Storage Cold/Archive Tier: Store infrequently accessed records in Cold or Archive tiers for significant cost savings.

Azure Functions: Implement serverless functions for archival tasks, reducing the cost of always-on infrastructure.

Data Caching: Use Azure Redis Cache to temporarily cache records from Blob Storage to reduce repeated access to archived data.
